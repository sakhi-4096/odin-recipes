    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

        <li>2 red onions, chopped</li>
        <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic paste</li>
        <li>4 ripe tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cups water, divided</li>
        <li>14 ounces dried beef</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Ethiopian berbere seasoning</li>
        <li>½ cup Ethiopian kibbeh (spiced clarified butter)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>2 pieces injera (Ethiopian bread)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place onions in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, covered, until starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Add vegetable oil 
            and garlic paste; cook until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes; cook until softened, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir 1/2 cup water, dried beef, and berbere seasoning into the saucepan. Reduce heat to medium and cook until flavors combine, 
            about 10 minutes. Continue cooking, adding 1/3 cup water every few minutes, until beef is softened and sauce is thick, about 20 
            minutes. Stir in kibbeh and salt.</li>
        <li>Tear 1 injera into palm-sized pieces; fold gently into the sauce. Serve beef and sauce over whole injera.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Cook's Note:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Substitute 4 cloves minced garlic for the garlic paste if desired.</li>
        <li>Substitute chili powder for the berbere seasoning if desired.</li>
        <li>Substitute beef stock for the water if preferred. Reduce salt if using beef stock.</li>
    </ul>
