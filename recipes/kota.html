    <h1>Chicken Kota Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../img/kota.jpg" alt="Chicken Kota served with a coke" style="width: 750px;height: 550px;px;">
    <h3>A kota is a true South African gem. Chicken strips and patties add an extra layer of yumminess to this township favourite. Enjoy!</h3>
    <p>"Kota" is an approximation of the word "quarter," for <strong>the quarter of the loaf of bread that is the base of the sandwich</strong>. 
        This is kind of like a bunny chow, but not. Instead, the bread is hollowed out, filled first with a layer of seasoned french fries, 
        then topped with optional layers of sauce, cheese, egg, and meat.
