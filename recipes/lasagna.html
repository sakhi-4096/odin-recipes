            green peppers, onion, and garlic, cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes, stir in pasta sauce and basil, bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer
            for 15 minutes. While the sauce is simmering, mix together ricotta, 2 cups mozzarella cheese, and eggs in a medium bowl. Pregeat the oven to 350 degrees
