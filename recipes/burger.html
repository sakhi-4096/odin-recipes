    <h3>Merguez sausage is not commonly stocked at the grocery store, so I decided to come up with an easy home version. Enjoy!</h3>
    <p>To make merguez, lamb shoulder is ground, spiced, mixed with a little fat, and stuffed into sheep casings. This forms a small 
        sausage, usually about 4 inches long and less than an inch in diameter. Lamb merguez is commonly available as a fresh sausage, 
        though there are sun–dried versions in North Africa.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons harissa, or to taste (see Ingredient note)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground lamb</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine salt and fennel seeds in a mortar and pestle and pound until fine. Stir cumin, cinnamon, coriander, turmeric, 
            and garlic cloves into the salt mixture and continue grinding to form a thick paste. Stir in harissa sauce and tomato 
            paste until combined.</li>
        <li>Combine ground lamb and the spice paste together with a fork in a large bowl. Cover and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Form sausage into patties. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patties until no longer pink inside, 
            5 to 8 minutes per side, depending on the size of the patties.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Cook's Note:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>To serve as burgers, top with sliced cucumbers, tomatoes, and crumbled feta in a toasted bun.</li>
        <li>This recipe calls for 2 tablespoons of Chef's John's Harissa Sauce recipe.</li>
    </ul>
